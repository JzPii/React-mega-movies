## Required User Stories:

- [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.
- [x]  For each movie, the user can see the Movie Title, Year, Rating, and Poster.
- [x]  The user can see this information clearly on devices of various screen sizes.
- [x]  The user can see "more" movies by tapping a "See More" button at the bottom.

### Optional User Stories:

- [x]  The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.; the user can type "mar" and the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
- [ ]  The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB).
- [ ]  Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa)
- [ ]  Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed. You could use React Input Range package for this task.


### Rocket 1: Pagination.

- [ ]  Pagination: Replace the "See More" with a page control, with a previous and next Button at the end. Click it will move user to the next 20 (or previous 20) movies. Remember at first load, the Previous button should be disabled.
- [ ] In addition to Previous and Next, use Number Pagination. Click on Number 3 will get them to Page3 and display movies 61st - 79th.


### Rocket 2: Routing

- [ ] For each movie, include a link (movie/id) to display the full Movie Info on another page (URL). Use React Router for this. You'll also have to figure out how to retrieve the parameters from the URL.
